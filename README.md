# title-casing
Ever used Python before? If you have you'll know that Python has a built in function for string manipulation called `.title()`. It's very helpful but if you've ever used JavaScript you'd have
noticed you only have `.toLowerCase()` and `.toUpperCase()`. Well look no further because I have solved all of your issues!! 

# What is title case?
```javascript
let normalString = "thiSIsAString";
let titleString = "Thisisastring";
```

# Uses?
String manipulation and I'm sure you'll find more uses.ðŸ˜€

# Example usage
```javascript
import { toTitleCase } from "./index.js";

let output = toTitleCase("stRing");
```

In this example we give a string to the function and it will convert it too title case and after that we can store the output in a variable to use elsewhere.

```bash
Outcome: String
```

The outcome is shown above.
